* Using DMRG as the FCI solver for CASSCF.  There are three DMRG solver
  interfaces implemented in this module

      Block (https://pyscf.org/Block/) or block2 (https://pypi.org/project/block2/)
      CheMPS2 (https://github.com/SebWouters/CheMPS2)
      QCMaquis (https://github.com/qcscine/qcmaquis)

  After installing the DMRG solver, create a file dmrgscf/settings.py
  to store the path where the DMRG solver was installed.

  Detailed instruction for using ``StackBlock`` or ``block2`` as the DMRG solver for CASSCF
  can be found in this [documentation](https://block2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/dmrg-scf.html).
